    "Kaggle is an excellent concept, a wonderful group of folks, and a justly renowned educational platform. But it's not perfect. I really wish they had somewhat better explanations/tutorials/etc. for navigating their tools from the perspective of a non-computer-science-major. It's not at all obvious, for example, how to proceed when 'Cuda is out of memory', when 'notebook threw exception' (but no further details), or when 'internet must be disabled' (despite Kaggle not having the module otherwise available) is the feedback you get. There were multiple times where I just had to give up on model variations because despite them running cleanly in Jupyter, they wouldn't run in Kaggle; or despite them running in Kaggle, they wouldn't run in the submission. Based on the discussion boards, mods' contributions, and site updates, they seem to be aware, at least, that some of these things are adversely impacting a lot of users, but so far none of the answers provided worked for me (or either I was doing them wrongly -- a very real possibility, but if I, a motivated and well-educated user, can't figure them out, doesn't that just reinforce my point?).\n",

    "In any event, my biggest frustration was with the dataset itself. I'll explore that briefly here, and please let me know what you think!"

My point, though, is that there appears to be a good bit of the messiness and impulsivity that human graders are prone to -- for example, being impressed/in a good mood/hungry/liking the student/fearing the parent/not wanting the headache... (or the opposite). When you're trying to meet your friends at the bar in time for the game, and you've got a stack of 30,000 essays to label and grade, you just default to 'Adequate', then when you see something that is even mildly impressive (or the name of a student you're fond of, etc., etc.), you throw-in an occasional 'Effective.' When you're tired or bored or spiteful and/or you come across a particularly awful text, you throw it in the ineffective pile.\n",

Only the most extreme cases of goood/bad are labeled as such.\n",

    "I suppose you could make the case that the ambiguity and inconsistency and so on are part-and-parcel to the nature of this type of data or this type of project, and that the goal isn't to make the model necessarily *good* at evaluating essays, only to make the model *comparable to* the average of judgments made by the graders. But as a former teacher, I can tell you that humans are quite prone to sloppiness, incoherence, arbitrariness, and inconsistency. Ignoring the 'no there there' problem (i.e., that there *is* no meaningful pattern here, and thus any model will be useless in terms of generalizability), imagine what it would look like to deploy such a model. Do we really want -- or consider it in any way to be progress -- to have a machine-- one that informs schools, publishing houses, standardized exam makers, and so on -- that 'correctly' marks both dangling clauses full of misspellings *and* reasonable (if stylistically modest) counterclaims as both being adequate compositions? \n",
    "\n",
    "Put differently, it seems to me that any model fit to this dataset would accomplish the exact opposite of what we'd want in such a product. That is, we'd presumably want to outsource to a computer work that humans would do sloppily, lazily, in a biased manner, in an inconsistent manner, and so forth. If my eyes have glazed over after essay 400 and my mind has turned to such a soup that I'm unable to distinguish or discriminate any better than what's shown in these excerpts, no computer should be told to try and capture exactly how I'm thinking in that context! When we've trained, in the past, models on text that is racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory, we've ended up with racist and sexist AI. If we train models on text that reflects human errors or inconsistencies or whatever, then we'll have a grader that's just as bad as the error-prone human it's meant to replace. Of course, a neural network *can* discover *any* function -- even a chaotic, disorderly one-- but that doesn't mean it's any *good*. Any deployable model needs to have consistent parameters for identifying good from bad in a generalizable way, and if it is fit to such an idiosyncratic, slapdash dataset, it will yield a correspondingly chaotic framework. Consistently outputting nonsense may be consistent, but it's still nonsense. \n",
    "\n",
    "It seems, further, that AI which is trained on anything other than the best of human judgement will be a merely faster and less accountable source of errors, not a solution to them. We source the substance of AI's 'thought' through human-created data. Only the very best of this data ought to be captured in the algorithms we generate, and only be deployed after we've carefully confirmed this to be the case. That's the only way to ensure consistency, accuracy, and unbiased evaluation. Having mined this dataset for the better part of two months, and having expectation after expectation disconfirmed in model-testing, I'm not sure I'm convinced this is that sort of dataset, and I'm skeptical that any model derived from it is useful in terms of deployment. I certainly wouldn't want to be graded by it. \n",

    "I think the intention of this project is very noble and worthwhile, but without better data, I doubt it will do much in terms of ameliorating the limitations of present writing-feedback tools. The performance of this task requires both normative and aesthetic judgments, and Thanksgiving dinner with your family is all that's required to prove that objectivity with respect to what constitutes 'soundness', 'validity', 'effectiveness', 'logical coherence', 'evidence', and so on is not definable. What's more, even when agreement can be achieved about what works conceptually, there is an almost infinite number of ways in which it may be shared. Hemingway and Shakespeare may both be literary geniuses, but there's hardly a single quantifiable thing in their work that indicates that shared capacity. It is not the instantiation on paper, but the affective state brought about in human minds that distinguishes -- and links-- their work. Effective natural language processing is as much about human minds -- intentions, feelings, inclinations, sarcasm, bias -- as it is about the actual words that are present. This requires sensitivity to not only the structural elements of analysis (linguistics, statistical methods) -- the \"processing,\" if you will --  but also to the \"natural\"-- the way humans actually use it, the way one individual's thoughtful remark is another's inconsiderate snarkiness, or the way one person's common sense is another's blatant falsehood. When you pair this with the way that language is inherently ambiguous, contextually dependent, and inseparable from models of the world and one's experiences therein, it seems unlikely that the statistical sophistication will be sufficient on its own to achieve what this project sets out to.\n",

    "I mentioned above that I thought web-scraping for essays to use would be a better approach to building what the competition seems to be looking for. I think this would ameliorate at least some of the dataset's issues. For one thing, when an essay is selected to be *featured*, it is because that dataset is likely indisputably an example of the score it seeks to model. That level of reliability -- graded once by the tired, overworked grader, then implicitly graded again by the author of the website's post-- would ensure that the fickleness and caprice of the human grader wasn't mixed in with the reliable examples. Additionally, the diversity of topic-prompts that would be represented in this way would ensure that topical noise didn't confuse the learner, forcing it to focus on structural elements of the essay. Lastly, a 'segment identifier' algorithm could be built alongside the scoring algorithm, allowing the learner to 'recognize' complete instances of essay portions, rather than having the dataset be peppered with single-word elements.
